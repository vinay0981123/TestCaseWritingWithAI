How It Works
This program simplifies the process of writing test cases by dynamically adding them to associated .xlsx files. Here's how it operates:

File Structure:
Ensure that the main.py file is located in the same directory as the .xlsx file(s) serving as templates for test cases.

Execution:
Upon running main.py, a web interface is launched.
Clicking the "+" icon within the interface triggers the addition of predefined test case templates to the corresponding .xlsx file(s) in the directory.

Dependencies:
The program relies on specific Python libraries listed in requirements.txt, which can be installed using pip.
